# Vile's Mods
A repository for all of Vile's Rimworld mods and patches.
 
I've started a Patreon, which I also use as a sorta blog! Check it out, and support me if you wish! http://patreon.com/vileheathen. 

Thank you for all the great support and feedback, and to all the talented modders of the HSK team and beyond. This wouldn't be possible without all of you!

INSTALLATION:
Simply place these in the /mods/ folder with the rest of the HSK mods. When activating after you load the game, put them in the order listed below, somewhere near the bottom of the list.

A quick rundown of what we got so far, and recommended mod-order:


- ***Wood You Please*** - Overhauls trees and wood. Each tree species gives a unique type of wood with unique stats and color, adding variety and complexity, kind of like animal leathers.

- ***Vile's Pre-Industrial*** - This is available as an optional mod in Hardcore SK and is required for Metallurgy. Retextures, rebalances, and adds content - mainly armor and black powder weapons - ranging from neolithic up until industrial tech.

- ***Vile's Metallurgy*** - Overhauls production of pre-industrial matierals - mainly steel, increasing complexity and realism. Adds new alloys, production buildings, weapons, tools, and more.

- ***Hardcore Renovation*** - This is formerly "Vile's Wall sand Floors HD". Adds tons of and retextures walls, floors, fences, and doors. Utilizes the new wood system.

- ***Biomes: From The Ground Up*** - Overhauls biomes, retextures every tree and most plants, and adds some new ones, both decorative and harvestable. Overhauls soils to be more biome-specific, and of course new textures. Besides beautification, the main purpose of this mod is to make biomes more distinct from each other.

- ***Amuse Bouche*** - A meals overhaul. No more generalized "fine meals" etc. Adds tons of recipes with origins from around the world and streamlines the food hediff system.

- ***Hell-Bent for Leather Tanning*** - Revises leathers and furs, and adds a tanning requirement to use them.

- ***Work Tab for Big Fonts*** - Reorganizes and relabels certain workdefs to make the Work Tab more legible.

- ***RimThemes*** - Adds new themes to the RimThemes mod. MERGE THIS FOLDER with the current RimThemes folder. Do not delete the original folder.

Update September 20, 2021 - Updated for 1.3

These Rimworld mods are meant to work with Hardcore SK. They're currently built for Rimworld 1.4, so you'll need the dev branch here, if you're not already playing it: https://github.com/skyarkhangel/Hardcore-SK/tree/development

Adding these mods is unlikely to break your savegames, though weird things might happen and you'll be missing out on some content, so I recommend starting a new save file.
Note that Hardcore Renovations requires both my brand new mod "Wood You Please", as well as "Fences and Floors". The latter is not my mod, but I'm including a patched version that's needed.

Please send any bug reports or balance/gameplay issues my way on Discord. Thanks!
