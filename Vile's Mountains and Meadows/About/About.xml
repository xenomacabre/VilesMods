Adds three biomes: 
Prairie (a temperate grassland)
Montane Forest (a boreal forest variation, less dense, may contain lakes)
Montane Birch Grasslands (a cold grassland)
Adds back Cloudberries, and a new flower, bluebells.

Uses Odeum's Biomes Kit (details below) 

BiomesKit is a framework for the placement of biomes on the world map at worldgen. Previously, modders needed to utilize C# to add new biomes to rimworld. With BiomesKit, placement of a biome can be controlled with XML tags in the BiomeDef itself.

With BiomesKit as a dependency, you too can make your own biomes mod with minimal hassle! Features of BiomesKit includes but are not limited to:
* Spawning biomes based on factors like elevation, rainfall, hilliness and more!
* Restricting your biome to spawn only on specific vanilla biomes, or even biomes from other mods!
* Changing the hilliness of a tile to a specific level, or even randomizing it!
* Custom world map tile graphics for your biome!
