* Jail Door (1x1) - Stronger door to keep prisoners inside.
* Gates (2x1) - Stylized doors perfect for meeting pre-industrial needs.
* Remote Doors (1x1, 2x1, 3x1) - Garage-style doors that can be opened by remote buttons or levers.
* Blast Doors (1x1, 2x1, 3x2) - Incredibly tough and secure doors used to keep greater threats at bay. Also can be opened by remote buttons or levers.
* Autodoors (2x1, 3x2) - Double/triple sized autodoors. All autodoors (including vanilla 1x1 autodoor) also can be opened by remote buttons or levers.
