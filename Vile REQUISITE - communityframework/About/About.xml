The Community Framework is a framework that gives more power to modders that use XML. It has multiple features made by the community, for all of which the documentation can be found on github.
Have you ever wrote a small bit of C# code that could be useful to others, but wasn't really enough to justify making a mod for? This is exactly the reason the Community Framework was created.
Submit your code, have it checked by other coders and have it added to this mod!
