This is where I keep minor tweaks for my own personal use. I'll try to keep the file names descriptive so you can delete files and tailor it to your liking.

Changes:
1. Variations of badge textures, added some new ones to cover more skills and military roles.
2. Increased asexual/bisexual/gay commonalities make it more realistic.
3. Inreases likelyhood of a cold snap in winter.
