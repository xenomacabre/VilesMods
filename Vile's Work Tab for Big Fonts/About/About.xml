VILE'S Work Tab for Big Fonts        
=====================================
This mod is a minor accessibility mod meant to make the microscopic work tab information easier to see. It is meant to work with the new Vile RimThemes.

- Changes the labels of jobs in the work tab, so instead of Craft: "Do Bills at Neolithic Craft" (which appears as "Do Bills at Ne..." in larger fonts), it's shortened to just "Neolithic".
- Work Types are now ALL CAPS so that they stand apart more from the work defs when you open the worktype to see the subjobs. 
- Some things are moved around. If you don't want that, delete the "reorganized" folder in Patches, and "WorkTypes.xml" in Defs. 

New WorkTypes:
MISC - This is mostly unusued junk. Stuff that may be required by other mods to exist, but typically aren't used in modded HSK.
PROCESSING - This is for mosly hauling jobs that are a bit more on the crafting side. Universal Fermenter jobs are moved here, which includes things like the drying rack, tanning vats, kiln, and cementation furnace.
BIOTECH HAULING - Simply moves some stuff out of hauling into a new work type.

Some other notable changes:
- Refill Water and Refuel Refuelable Buildings (now called "Refuel") are moved to the BASIC worktype.
- Neolithic Crafting is moved to the SMITHING worktype
